### A series of notebooks in which I collect, prepare, analyze, and visualize data. Also I determine the best metamorph model for the data by calculating the accuracy and plotting various confusion matrices.

This is done in Clojure, the main reason is that sometime ago I saw a notebook in github where they performed sentiment analysis with clojure, I then decided to also make a clojure notebook except that it was
going to cover all of the above, I used the Beakerx kernel.


#### Note: for the visualization app go to Labrico25.github.io
